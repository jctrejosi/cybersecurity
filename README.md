# Cybersegurity class

This course provides a comprehensive overview of information security, covering key concepts like data protection, threats, vulnerabilities, and the CIA triad. Students will explore security frameworks, endpoint and network protection, and learn to manage access, authentication, and incidents. The class also includes practical methodologies for implementing layered security and governance standards.

## Labs

Solve [DockerLabs](https://dockerlabs.es/) challenges

Below is a list of the machines I have resolved. Each machine has its own directory with a detailed README file.

| Machine Name | Link to README | Description |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| [Crackoff](./Labs/Crackoff) | [README](./Labs/Crackoff/README.md) | Machine focused on **password cracking** practices (brute force, dictionary attacks, weak hashes). Perfect for learning tools like John the Ripper or Hashcat. |
| [Mirame](./Labs/Mirame) | [README](./Labs/Mirame/README.md) | Web exploitation challenge with common vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, LFI). Great for diving into the **OWASP Top 10**. |
| [PingPong](./Labs/PingPong) | [README](./Labs/PingPong/README.md) | Focused on network protocol attacks (**ICMP, UDP/TCP**) and host discovery techniques. Can you intercept the "game"? |
| [r00tless](./Labs/r00tless) | [README](./Labs/r00tless/README.md) | Advanced **privilege escalation** machine (Linux/Windows). Exploit misconfigurations or vulnerable kernels to gain root access. |

- Each subdirectory under `/Labs` corresponds to a different machine.
- The README file within each subdirectory provides detailed information about the solution and techniques used.
- This is for educational purposes and should be used responsibly.
