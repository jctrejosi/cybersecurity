# Cybersegurity class

This course provides a comprehensive overview of information security, covering key concepts like data protection, threats, vulnerabilities, and the CIA triad. Students will explore security frameworks, endpoint and network protection, and learn to manage access, authentication, and incidents. The class also includes practical methodologies for implementing layered security and governance standards.

## Labs

Solve [DockerLabs](https://dockerlabs.es/) challenges

Below is a list of the machines I have resolved. Each machine has its own directory with a detailed README file.

| Machine Name | Difficulty  | Link to README | Description |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| [r00tless](./Labs/r00tless) | Hard       | [README](./Labs/r00tless/README.md) | Advanced **privilege escalation** (Linux/Windows). Exploit misconfigurations or kernel vulnerabilities to gain root. |
| [Crackoff](./Labs/Crackoff) | Hard       | [README](./Labs/Crackoff/README.md) | **Password cracking** practice (brute force, dictionaries, weak hashes). Ideal for learning tools like John the Ripper or Hashcat. |
| [Mirame](./Labs/Mirame) | Easy       | [README](./Labs/Mirame/README.md) | Web exploitation challenge with common vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, LFI). Perfect introduction to **OWASP Top 10**. |
| [PingPong](./Labs/PingPong) | Intermediate | [README](./Labs/PingPong/README.md) | Network protocol attacks (**ICMP, UDP/TCP**) and host discovery. Can you intercept the "game"? |

- Each subdirectory under `/Labs` corresponds to a different machine.
- The README file within each subdirectory provides detailed information about the solution and techniques used.
- This is for educational purposes and should be used responsibly.
